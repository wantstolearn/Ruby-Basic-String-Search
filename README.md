Ruby-Basic-String-Search
========================

New learner playing around with string searches, trying to find the best ways to search a user-inputted string for desired characters eg numbers, or symbols.
Example : a user is invited to enter a desired price for some item. So acceptable inpout would be $4 or 4 ie a digit between 1-9 or a digit between 1-9 with a dollar symbol (US version).
Any other input should print an error and the code should be able to accept either e.g. 4 or $4.
Example:
A user is asked a question, the input can only be letters or numbers so any other characters should result in an error message eg $ % ^ etc should not be accepted as input.

At this point I don't understand much Ruby, and dont know anythign about using Github :-) Fun times ahead :-)
